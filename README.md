# Work-Spaces

Work-Spaces was created with MeteorJS, Blaze, ReactJS, MongoDB, and Bootstrap.

The purpose of this project is to make bins where you can make markups visually
and save it or share it with your friends/collaborator. Users are able to
create/delete/share/edit bins. User authentication is also implemented to store
users in database (mongoDB).
